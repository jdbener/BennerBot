Hello, my name is Jdbener and today I am going to give you a basic walk through of how to use my twitch/hitbox chatbot, BennerBot! Bennerbot has been designed differently than other chatbots, it is designed by streamers for streamers, it has been designed to manage both twitch and hitbox simultaneously, it has also been written in java so it can be used from anywhere!

The last working version of the code can be found [here](https://github.com/jdbener/BennerBot/tree/99a61de16bc1712fd392c8e9ab6fce06185fd28f).

Java was proving too slow for what I was trying to do, so I am refactoring my code into C++. I should be able to maintain the same amount of cross platform compatability with greatly improved performance and efficency. The new code can be found [here](https://github.com/jdbener/BennerBot/tree/C%2B%2B).
